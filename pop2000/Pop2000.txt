  Description:
    Abstract: Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/Line was used to divide Rhode Island into Tract, Block Group and Block levels. The TIGER/Line data set was joined with Census 2000 Redistricting Data to calculate the population density per square mile.
    Purpose: Tabular and Geographic US Census 2000 information for general GIS use.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Fields within the joined data set include state/county code [Fipsstco], Tract, Block Group, Block, unique state to block level Id [stfid], RI Tract to Block level Id [Ricens2000], Acres, Square Miles, Population Density, Population, Water and Town Name.  Census 2000 Summary File 1 was used to obtain the total population over 18 [Pop18over] at the block level.    Tract-Block field [TR_BLK] was created  to join the [pop18over] to the previously  joined TIGER/Line data and Census 2000 Redistricting Data.
        Note:  [   ] represents a field name within the polygon attribute table.  RIDEM joined the tabular data from the Census 2000 Redistricting Data P.L. 94-171 Summary File with the Redistricting Census 2000 TIGER/LINE geographic data set.  [Acres] and square miles [Mi_2]  were converted from the ESRI calculated [AREA] in square feet.  Population density [Pop_Dens]  was then calculated  per square mile and [STFID] was computed as a concatenation of State, County, Tract, Block Group and Block ID's.
        RIGIS recalculated the Census Tract ID to represent the tract name.  The tract name [Ctract2000] excludes preceding zeros and has an optional two digit suffix.  Block Group [Bgroup2000] was computed as a unique Block Group # within each Census Tract using a concatenation of the [Ctract2000] and the first digit of [Block2000].   RI Census [RIcens2000] was computed as a concatenation of Tract, Block Group and Block ID's.   [Water] was identified and computed by viewing the last three digits of [Block2000].  All [Block2000] id's ending in 987-999 were considered water blocks and computed as [Water] = 'Y'.  All other [Block2000] id's were computed as [Water] = 'N'.  Town names [Town] were selected & defined using RIGIS town boundaries.   [TR_BLK] was computed as a concatenation of Tract and Block numbers.  TR_BLK was used as the common field to join the census 2000 Summary File 1 population over 18 [Pop18over] field to the previously joined TIGER/Line data set and Census 2000 Redistricting data.
